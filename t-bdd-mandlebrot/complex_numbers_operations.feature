
Given two complex numbers with components: real 6, imaginary 7 and real 2, imaginary -1

When I add them
Then I should get a complex number with components: real 8, imaginary 6

When I subtract the second from the first
Then I should get a complex number with components: real 4, imaginary 8

Given two complex numbers with components: real 6, imaginary 7 and real 2, imaginary -1
When I multiply them
Then I should get a complex number with components: real 1, imaginary 1
